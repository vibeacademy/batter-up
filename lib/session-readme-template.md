Welcome to your TDD learning session! This directory contains your exercise files.

## 📁 Session Info

- **Exercise**: {EXERCISE_NAME}
- **Session Directory**: `{SESSION_DIR}`
- **Created**: {TIMESTAMP}

## 🎯 Your Mission

Implement the code to make all tests pass! Follow the Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle:

1. **RED** 🔴 - Tests are failing (you're here!)
2. **GREEN** 🟢 - Write code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR** 🔄 - Improve your code while keeping tests green

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
pytest -v
```

Run this command frequently as you implement! Watch the tests turn from red to green.

### 3. Start Implementing
Open `{IMPLEMENTATION_FILE}` and start with the first test. Work through them in order - they're designed to build on each other.

## 📝 Files in This Session

- `{IMPLEMENTATION_FILE}` - Your implementation goes here
- `{TEST_FILE}` - The test suite (don't modify this)
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies needed for testing
- `README.md` - This file!
- `REVIEW.md` - Will be created after code review

## 💡 Tips

- **Run tests often** - After every small change, run `pytest -v`
- **Read error messages carefully** - They tell you what to fix
- **Work incrementally** - Get one test passing at a time
- **Ask questions** - If you're stuck, just ask for help!
- **Don't modify tests** - Your job is to make the existing tests pass

## 📖 Exercise Requirements

See the original specification at:
`{SPEC_PATH}`

## ✅ When You're Done

Once all tests pass:
1. Tell me "tests pass" or share the pytest output
2. I'll verify by running tests automatically
3. Code Reviewer will provide feedback
4. Review will be saved to `REVIEW.md` in this directory

## 🆘 Need Help?

Just ask! I can:
- Clarify what a test expects
- Explain error messages
- Provide hints (not solutions!)
- Discuss Python best practices

**Remember**: In TDD, failing tests are your friends! They tell you exactly what to build next.

Happy coding! 🎉
